Graphics32
==========

This is an adapted version of Graphics32 based on Graphics32
version 1.7pre.

The original Delphi version only has some minor changes.
To make it Fpc/Lazarus compatible defines and packages were
added where needed.

To overcome problems with automatic rebuilding of Lazarus circular
dependencies had to be fixed. Therefore code in several units was
reordered and two new units were added.
